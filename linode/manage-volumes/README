This script will clone backups and delete old ones.  Follow the steps below
to build:

If you use a private Docker repo to host your images, use 'sudo docker login'
to save your credentials to /root/.docker/config.json, then temporarily copy
that file to your home directory and store it as a new secret in your cluster:

    kubectl create secret generic dockercredentials \
        --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=/home/andrew/config.json \
        --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson

Once stored, delete the copy of the credentials and continue below.

1. Create a linode API key and save it as a key value pair (key: token) inside
   a new secret named linode-api (which can have multiple key value pairs):

   kubectl create secret generic linode-api --from-literal=token=XXXXXXXXXXX

2. Build the docker image and push it to a public repo (MAKE SURE THERE'S
   NOTHING SENSITIVE IN THE IMAGE): 

     sudo docker build -t martopoulos/linode-manage-volumes .
     sudo docker push martopoulos/linode-manage-volumes:latest

3. Deploy to your kubernetes cluster as a cron job:
    kubectl apply -f backup-cron.yaml
